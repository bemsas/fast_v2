# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves recreating the exact front page for Venipak logistics company based on provided Figma design files. The implementation must be pixel-perfect, matching every design element, spacing, typography, color, and interaction as specified in the Figma files. The user will provide specific Figma objects and components to be used for accurate recreation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the Venipak front page, I want to recreate every visual element exactly as shown in the Figma design, so that the final result matches the approved design specifications perfectly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any component THEN the system SHALL match the exact dimensions, colors, and typography specified in the Figma file
2. WHEN positioning elements THEN the system SHALL use the exact spacing and alignment values from the Figma design
3. WHEN implementing text content THEN the system SHALL use the exact copy, font families, sizes, and weights as specified
4. WHEN creating layouts THEN the system SHALL replicate the exact grid system and breakpoints from the Figma design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement all interactive elements exactly as designed in Figma, so that user interactions match the intended design behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing hover states THEN the system SHALL replicate the exact hover effects shown in the Figma prototypes
2. WHEN creating clickable elements THEN the system SHALL use the exact button styles, states, and transitions from Figma
3. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL match the exact menu structure and styling specified in the design
4. WHEN adding animations THEN the system SHALL use the timing, easing, and effects defined in the Figma prototypes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract and use the exact assets from the Figma file, so that all images, icons, and graphics match the original design perfectly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using images THEN the system SHALL export them at the exact dimensions and quality specified in Figma
2. WHEN implementing icons THEN the system SHALL use the exact SVG exports or icon specifications from the design
3. WHEN applying colors THEN the system SHALL use the exact hex/RGB values defined in the Figma color palette
4. WHEN implementing graphics THEN the system SHALL maintain the exact visual hierarchy and styling from the original design

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement responsive behavior exactly as specified in the Figma design, so that the page displays correctly across all intended device sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL match the desktop layout specifications from Figma exactly
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the system SHALL implement the tablet breakpoint layout as designed (if provided)
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL match the mobile layout specifications from Figma exactly
4. WHEN transitioning between breakpoints THEN the system SHALL maintain the exact responsive behavior defined in the design

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement the exact content structure and hierarchy from the Figma design, so that all text, headings, and content blocks appear exactly as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing headings THEN the system SHALL use the exact text content, hierarchy levels, and styling from Figma
2. WHEN adding body text THEN the system SHALL match the exact copy, line heights, and paragraph spacing specified
3. WHEN creating content sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the exact content flow and organization from the design
4. WHEN implementing lists or structured content THEN the system SHALL replicate the exact formatting and styling from Figma

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive specific guidance on which Figma objects and components to use, so that I can implement each section accurately without guesswork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing each section THEN the system SHALL use the exact Figma component or object specified by the user
2. WHEN extracting design tokens THEN the system SHALL reference the specific Figma layers, styles, and properties indicated
3. WHEN implementing functionality THEN the system SHALL follow the exact specifications provided for each Figma object
4. WHEN completing each component THEN the system SHALL validate against the specific Figma reference provided
