## Design Implementation Approach

This project follows a **Figma-first approach** where every design decision is based on the exact specifications provided in the Figma design files. The implementation prioritizes:

1. **Pixel-perfect accuracy** - Exact matching of dimensions, spacing, and visual elements
2. **Design token system** - CSS custom properties for colors, typography, and spacing
3. **Responsive fidelity** - Exact breakpoints and responsive behavior from Figma
4. **Accessibility compliance** - Semantic HTML and WCAG guidelines
5. **Performance optimization** - Optimized assets and efficient code

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Asset Extraction (Task 2)
- Extract design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) from Figma styles
- Export all images, icons, and graphics at appropriate resolutions
- Document exact measurements and specifications

### Phase 2: Component Implementation (Tasks 3-6)
- Header and navigation with exact styling and interactions
- Hero section with precise layout and typography
- Content sections matching Figma specifications
- Interactive elements with exact hover states and animations

### Phase 3: Responsive Implementation (Task 7)
- Mobile layout matching Figma mobile design
- Tablet layout (if provided in Figma)
- Smooth transitions between breakpoints

### Phase 4: Asset Integration (Task 8)
- Integration of all Figma assets
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (Tasks 9-10)
- Accessibility enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Final pixel-perfect comparison with Figma

## Design Token System

The project uses CSS custom properties for maintainable design tokens:

```css
:root {
  /* Colors from Figma color palette */
  --color-primary: #[FIGMA_PRIMARY_COLOR];
  --color-secondary: #[FIGMA_SECONDARY_COLOR];
  
  /* Typography from Figma text styles */
  --font-family-primary: '[FIGMA_PRIMARY_FONT]', sans-serif;
  --font-size-h1: [FIGMA_H1_SIZE];
  
  /* Spacing from Figma spacing tokens */
  --spacing-md: [FIGMA_MD_SPACING];
  --spacing-lg: [FIGMA_LG_SPACING];
}
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

Breakpoints will be set to exact values from Figma design specifications:

- **Mobile**: 320px - 767px (exact mobile layout from Figma)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px (tablet layout if provided)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (desktop layout from Figma)

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Performance Goals

- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- First Input Delay < 100ms

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Focus management
- Alt text for all images

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the current implementation
2. Use browser developer tools to inspect responsive behavior
3. All design tokens are placeholders and will be populated with exact Figma values
4. Assets directories are prepared for Figma exports

## Implementation Notes

- All placeholder values marked with `[FIGMA_*]` will be replaced with exact values from Figma
- Component styles are structured for easy maintenance and updates
- JavaScript functionality is modular and follows accessibility best practices
- Animation system respects user's motion preferences
- Asset optimization maintains visual quality while improving performance

## Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment to Vercel. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

### Quick Deploy to Vercel

1. **Git Integration** (Recommended):
   - Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
   - Connect repository to Vercel
   - Automatic deployments on every push

2. **Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Drag & Drop**:
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Drag project folder to deploy

### Production URL
Once deployed, your site will be available at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Development Scripts

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (optional)
npm install -g vercel

# Local development server
vercel dev

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

## Next Steps

1. **Extract Design Tokens** - Replace all placeholder values with exact Figma specifications
2. **Export Assets** - Export and optimize all images, icons, and fonts from Figma
3. **Implement Components** - Build each section to match exact Figma layout and styling
4. **Add Interactions** - Implement hover states, animations, and interactive elements
5. **Responsive Testing** - Validate responsive behavior across all target devices
6. **Deploy to Production** - Use Vercel for fast, reliable hosting
7. **Quality Assurance** - Perform final comparison with Figma design for pixel-perfect accuracy
