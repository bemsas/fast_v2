# Fonts Directory

This directory will contain all custom fonts used in the Figma design:

- Primary font family files
- Secondary font family files
- Heading font files (if different)
- Font weights and styles as specified in Figma

Supported font formats:
- WOFF2 (preferred for modern browsers)
- WOFF (fallback for older browsers)
- TTF/OTF (if needed for specific requirements)

Font files should be organized by font family and include all weights and styles used in the Figma design.

Font loading will be optimized with:
- font-display: swap for better performance
- Proper fallback font stacks
- Preloading of critical fonts
