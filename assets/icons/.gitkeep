# Icons Directory

This directory will contain all icons exported from the Figma design:

- Navigation icons
- Social media icons
- Feature/service icons
- UI element icons
- Arrow and decorative icons

All icons should be exported as SVG files from Figma to ensure:
- Scalability at all screen sizes
- Crisp rendering on high-DPI displays
- Small file sizes
- Easy styling with CSS

Icons will be organized and named according to their usage in the design.
