# Images Directory

This directory will contain all images exported from the Figma design:

- Hero background images
- Section images and graphics
- Product/service images
- Company logos and branding assets
- Icon images (if not using SVG)

All images should be optimized for web use while maintaining the quality specified in the Figma design.

Recommended formats:
- WebP for modern browsers with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
- SVG for logos and simple graphics
- PNG for images requiring transparency
- JPEG for photographs and complex images

Images will be organized in subdirectories as needed based on the Figma design structure.
